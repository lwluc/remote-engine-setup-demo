# Artefact-Auto-Deployment

This charming little sub-module is your go-to enchantress, bringing the magic of auto-deployment to all your precious 
process artifacts (yes, that includes `*.bpmn`, `*.dmn`, and even `*.form`). It works its wonders through the REST API 
of the remote engine. So, no more manual toil â€“ let this friendly sub-module do the heavy lifting for you! âœ¨ðŸª„

Alternatively, if you'd rather not tinker with building the API client yourself or if your ambitions extend beyond 
just the deployment API, you might find the [camunda-engine-rest-client-openapi-springboot](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-platform-7-rest-client-java#spring-boot-starter) 
a splendid choice. It's like having an extra pair of helping hands for your Camunda endeavors! ðŸ˜Š
